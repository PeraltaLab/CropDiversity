suppressive capacity of soil microbiomes. Ecosphere 9(5):e02235. 10.1002/ecs2.2235

## We address the following questions

* **Aim 1.)**: What is the relationship between crop diversity and soil microbial community composition and PPS potential?

* **Aim 2.)**: What is the role of changes in soil physicochemical properties on the crop diversity effect on soil microbial community composition and PPS populations?

### Repo Contents

* **analyses:**: An R Markdown file that includes R script written by Mario Muscarella, Yanmei Sun, and Ariane Peralta containing functions used in analysis of soil and microbial sequence data.

* **bin:** 
	* *MothurTools.R*: An R script written by Mario Muscarella (Indiana University, now at University of Illinois) containing functions used in the analysis of community sequence data.

* **data:**: Files associated with soil and microbial data sets. 

* **figures:**: Figures (of soil, microbes) generated according to R script located in R Markdown file.

* **mothur:**: Files containing script for bioinformatic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences (Illumina MiSeq platform) using mothur pipeline.
