Crop Diversity - redo stats to double check for publication
To Do

based on 0.03 taxonomy of 16S rRNA Illumina sequences
(1) Run diversity analyses (Hdiversity, richness, evenness)
-need to re-run
(2) PERMANOVA 
-completed for treatment and for soil factors
(3) PCoA
-completed 
(4) Mantel test to compare total bacterial and PHLD communities (16S rRNA related to plant path suppression?) - we ran and no relationship 

Functional Gene Analysis (disease suppression)
(1) PRND gene qPCR ANOVA and boxplot
-completed
(2) PHLD gene TRFLP 
-PERMANOVA and PCoA (completed)
